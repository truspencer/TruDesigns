<p class="bio">I currently study Animation and Motion Graphics and enjoy drawing and writing in my spare time. Learning about multimedia and how to create things that I see daily, has broaden my horizons and has helped me learn more about myself. I am eager to learn more and eventually work in the field. I consider myself to be a very unique. I am obsessed with anime and gaming and I try to show that throughout my everyday life. I enjoy creating projects that relfect my "obsessions" and showing how creative I can be when working with them. My interest on Graphic Design stems from my interest in becoming a Game Designer and how the two professions go hand in hand. Besides anime and gaming, I like to make projects that reflect my heritage. My family is half Native- American and I love to show that.</p><br>

<p class="bio">A lot of my artwork inspiration stems from animes I've watched and from my studies in Japanese culture. I enjoy drawing original characters either of my friends or of myself and even having one of my friends animate the characters for me. Currently a few friends and I are working on making our own anime series and video game with characters based on ourselves. I'm glad I am able to learn how to use some of the Adobe programs I have learned so far. I feel with my current level of knowledge of them, I will be able to help my friends with the production with more than just my artwork.</p><br>

<p class="bio">Here is an example of one of the characters were going to using in our series. It's going to be out own take on Dragon Ball Z with some elements taken from the original series but the story itself is completely original.All of the artwok that I do is either drwan or digital. I prefer to sketch first before scanning it into the computer for me to continue to work on it. Right now I'm working on learning how to get my artwork copyrighted so when we start production, we won't have to worry about anyone stealing our work. </p>
