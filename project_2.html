		<h1>GIF Production</h1>
	</div><br>
	<p>For the GIF project, we were to create a gif using photoshop that represents or includes a phrase that we like. Some of the difficulties I ran into while creating the gif was exporting it correctly that way it will play the way it was suppose to. I fixed the save by going back to the presentation and finding the slide that mentioned it. The reason I chose "Freedom is Truth" is because for most of my childhood, I've always heard from family members and my mother that the truth will set you free. I never fully understood what that meant until I was older and fully became to embrace it espeacially how in some ironic twist I was named Tru.</p><br>
	<p>The process I used was a simple one. The first layer I created was the Gradient layer. I used a standard gradient that was already apart of the Photoshop program. The colors represented a sunset to me and it also included my favorite color. The second layer was the arrow which I found in the irregular shapes tool which allows you to create things such as arrows, hearts, and stars. The next two layers were the words "Freedom is" and "Truth".
	I had done this purposely so that words could appear at different times during the gif loop. The next step was to arrange when I wanted each object to appear in the gif and in what order. Next was to save the image as a gif and then save it for the web that way the computer will recognize it as a gif which would allow it to loop continously. </p>
